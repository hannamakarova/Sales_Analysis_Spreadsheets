According to the data, 1,330 orders were made from 46 countries, with a total sales volume of 830,498 units of products. The average product price is $265, and the average quantity per order is 7,648 units. The average profit per order is $377,018, indicating high profitability, despite average order costs of $902,778. The average delivery time is 24.78 days, with a median of 25 days, showing variability in delivery times. Sales are evenly distributed between online (663 orders) and offline (667 orders) channels.

The highest profits by category were generated from "Cosmetics" (over $90,000,000) and "Household Goods" (around $75,000,000). Categories such as "Vegetables," "Baby Food," and "Clothing" have lower profits ($25,000,000â€“$50,000,000), while the smallest profits come from "Beverages," "Office Supplies," and "Personal Care" (less than $25,000,000).

Among the countries, the highest profits were from Singapore ($47,185,158) and the United Kingdom ($42,530,350). Other countries, such as Anguilla ($25,900,743), the Marshall Islands ($25,779,788), and the Czech Republic ($25,218,513), have average profits. Smaller profits were seen in Liechtenstein ($8,397,411), Egypt ($8,002,174), and Lithuania ($7,997,298). There is a significant gap between the leaders (Singapore, the United Kingdom) and countries with lower profits.

Sales by channel: offline sales generated $253,466,519, while online sales generated $247,967,940, showing almost equal distribution of orders, but offline sales had a higher profit with fewer orders.

Delivery trends show that most countries have delivery times ranging from 18 to 28 days. The fastest delivery is in Hong Kong (18 days), followed by Dominica and Estonia with 20 and 21 days, respectively. Most European countries have delivery times of 24-25 days, and the longest delivery time is in Hungary (33 days).

6-7. Profit trends by month show volatility, with peaks in 2014 when monthly profits exceeded $10,000,000. In the following years, profits fluctuated between $5,000,000 and $7,500,000. The highest monthly profits were in January ($52,805,167) and June ($50,204,756), while the lowest were in August ($32,762,178) and April ($33,733,536). Annual profits peaked in 2012 ($87,884,066), after which there was a decline, particularly in 2013 and 2017.

In categories with lower income (fruits, meat, vegetables), profits gradually decreased after the peak in 2012-2014. "Cosmetics" remained the leader among high-income categories, although its profits also decreased after 2012.

Next, the document presents the top 10 countries and their income dynamics. In 2011-2012, there was a sales peak in most countries, especially in the United Kingdom and Singapore, after which a decline occurred in the following years. A sharp drop in sales was noted in Russia, where sales significantly decreased in 2013. At the same time, countries like Palau, the Marshall Islands, and the Maldives maintained more stable but low figures throughout the period.

Among product categories, the highest profits are observed in cosmetics, which also reached a peak in the 6th week, exceeding $20,000,000. Other categories, such as snacks, office supplies, and meat, showed stable but significantly lower results, usually under $10,000,000. Categories like vegetables and baby food remained at consistently low levels throughout all weeks.

Weekly analysis shows that the highest profits by country are generated by Singapore, peaking in the 6th week ($12,000,000). Other countries, such as the United Kingdom, show increases but their profits remain significantly lower.

The ABC analysis of 2017 showed that the largest contribution to the total revenue came from category A (office supplies), with a revenue of $417,139,077.60 (24.20% of total revenue), which has a huge impact on financial results. Category B (grains) makes up 13.55% of the revenue, while category C (beverages, fruits) generates only 4.67%.
